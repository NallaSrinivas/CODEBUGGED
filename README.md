# Sales Prediction Model Using LightGBM
## Overview
This project is a machine learning pipeline for predicting store sales using the LightGBM model. The data used for this project consists of historical sales data, along with additional information such as oil prices, holiday events, and store transactions. The goal is to predict future sales based on this information. The code was built using Python, leveraging popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and lightgbm.

## Requirements
To run the code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
  Python 3.x
  pandas
  numpy
  scikit-learn
  xgboost
  lightgbm
  matplotlib
  seaborn
